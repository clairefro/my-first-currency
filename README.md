## My first currency

First attempt at deploying ERC20 token

Following example of part II : [How to build a full stack decentralized app](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAO7YxF7hSk)

Using truffle box [nglglhtr/mytoken](https://github.com/nglglhtr/mytoken)

## Pre-requisites

Must have `truffle` and `ganache` installed

## Getting started

start blockchain

`truffle develop`

compile contracts

`truffle compile`

migrate contracts

## Note

Truffle expects `.sol` contract file names to match the `contract` name exactly.
